We have carefully developed a hybrid IDS, an autonomous IDS that can detect intrusions without human intervention is required for application in the IoT environment. The hybrid
IDS consists of a Host- based IDS (HIDS) and a Network- based IDS (NIDS). HIDS is to detect anomalies in the traffic using unsupervised algorithms - Fuzzy C-means, K-means. NIDS is used for malware detection using supervised algorithms like - Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbor. We have also compared the algorithms using metrics - TPR, FPR and accuracies and come to a conclusion for the best algorithm that can be used in each of the IDSs. For NIDS, SVM is considered to be the most
apt algorithm among others and for HIDS, it is Fuzzy C-means.
